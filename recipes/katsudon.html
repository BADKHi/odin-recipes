        <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>First we are going to pound the pork cutlet and lightly cut the fat on the side to keep the cultlet from curling upward.</li>
            <li>We're going to create our dredging station next. season your pork cultet with salt and pepper and lightly coat it with flour. In one bowl beat an egg and put your panko into another bowl.</li>
            <li>Add a thin layer of oil to a skillet over medium heat. Dip the flour coated cutlet into the egg batter. Then take the cutlet and put it into the bowl of panko and press the panko into the meat on both sides.</li>
            <li>lay the cutlet into the hot oil for 5 minutes for both sides until its golden brown. Once the cutlet is done let it drain and rest on its side.</li>
            <li>While the cutlet is resting, add your hondashi, sugar, mirin, soy sauce, and wedge sliced onions into a pan, and let it cook over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cut your cutlet into pieces and place it into the pan with the stock mixture. Drizzle the eggs over it and cook the eggs to your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Serve over a bowl of steamed rice, and garnish with scallions and Shichimi Togarashi.</li>
        </ol>
